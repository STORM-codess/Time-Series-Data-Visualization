# Time-Series-Data-Visualization
I'm thrilled to share the completion of my latest data visualization project! Here are the key highlights:

Project Goal: Visualized daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum (2016-2019) to analyze patterns, trends, and growth.
Tools Used: Pandas for data processing, Matplotlib for creating visualizations.

Data Cleaning: Filtered out outliers by removing the top and bottom 2.5% of daily page views for cleaner insights.

Visualizations 

Line Chart: Highlighted overall daily trends over the specified timeframe.

Bar Chart: Showed average daily page views for each month, grouped by year.



Box Plots: Compared yearly and monthly page view distributions to identify trends and seasonal patterns.

Insights Gained: Identified yearly growth trends and seasonal fluctuations in user engagement.

This project helped sharpen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling through data
